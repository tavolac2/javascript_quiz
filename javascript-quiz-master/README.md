WRA 410 Javascript Quiz

What I changed:

1. Added 10 unique questions to the quiz that deal with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and using the terminal.

2. Changed the text and images that are included on the <div> when you click on the "I'm finished!" button.

3. Added a button to the score <div> that would link you to another page when clicked that shows the answers to the questions.
    
4. On the answers page, I highlighted and bolded the multiple choice questions, and made the text boxes disabled with the answers inside.

5. Additionally, I added a, "Take the quiz again!" button to the bottom of the answers page to link back to the index so the user can take the quiz again.
